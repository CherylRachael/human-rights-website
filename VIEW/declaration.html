        <h2>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</h2>
        <p>
          The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the
          United Nations General Assembly in 1948 and consists of a preamble and
          30 articles.
        </p>
        <h3>Preamble</h3>
        <p>
          Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
          inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
          foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas
          disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
          acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of
          a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief
          and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest
          aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is essential, if man is
          not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion
          against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected
          by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to promote the development
          of friendly relations between nations, Whereas the peoples of the
          United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in
          fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
          and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to
          promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
          freedom, Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in
          co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal
          respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
          Now, therefore, The General Assembly proclaims this Universal
          Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for
          all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and
          every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind,
          shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these
          rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and
          international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and
          observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and
          among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.
